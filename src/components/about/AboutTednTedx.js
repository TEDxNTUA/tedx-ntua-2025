                            TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
                            Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED
                            has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The
                            two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and
                            doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are
                            then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included
                            Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
                            Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan
                            and Daniel Kahneman.

                        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local,
                        self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
                        experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers
                        combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local,
                        self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently
                        organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance
                        for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.
